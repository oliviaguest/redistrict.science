      <p>This is the website accompanying the manuscript <i>Gerrymandering and Computational Redistricting</i> by <a href="//oliviaguest.com">Olivia Guest</a> and <a href="//bradlove.org">Bradley C. Love</a>.</p>

      <p>For the materials used, please see the Open Framework Repository (OSF), here: <a href="https://osf.io/8xpq4/">osf.io/8xpq4</a>.
      This repository will contain: a) the code used to create the maps, perform the clustering, etc.;
      b) instructions on how to download the data used to carry out the redistricting from the US Census;
      c) individual maps per state which show the districts as they are and our solutions;
      d) the corruption scores per state from the Center for Public Integrity; along with e) links to any other code or materials used.

      <h2>Maps</h2>

      <p>Below are interactive maps showing the existing districts (left column) and the results from our weighted <i>k</i>-means algorithm (right column).
      The colors used are to facilitate viewing and are randomly assigned.
      Moving your cursor over a state highlights its border in black.
      Clicking on a state zooms both maps in, allowing you to see the state's districts close up for both reality and our solution.
      To find a specific location click on the magnifying glass, on the top left of both maps, to open up a search box.</p>
